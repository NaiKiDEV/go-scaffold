# Scaffolding tool for any code generation in file system

Currently the templates are baked into the binary. Planned to add dynamic templates.

- Template variable injection in directories, files and code itself.

## Further improvements

- Try reading thunks.scaffold.json to build config tree and generate files from dynamic templates generated by the user.
- cli tool execution as pre and after steps of scaffolding
- cli tools execution configuration for each directory and file as pre or post creation step
- template injections inside cli commands
