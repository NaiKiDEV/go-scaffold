# Scaffolding tool for any code generation in file system

Currently the templates are baked into the binary or read from predefined scaffold json files.

- Template variable injection in directories, files and code itself.
- Reading template and variables json files

## Examples

Using external_templates which are based on json configs:

```sh
go run . --templFile=./external_templates/basic.scaffold.json
```

Using built-in templates:

```sh
go run . --templName=basic
```

Scaffolding in deeper folder:

```sh
go run . --templFile=./external_templates/basic.scaffold.json --baseDir=./nested-root-dir
```

Alternatively, you can build the project using:

```sh
go build
```

On Windows, after building you can pass the same options, but using the built binary:

```powershell
.\go-scaffold.exe --templFile=./external_templates/basic.scaffold.json
```

## Further improvements

- Try reading scaffold.json to build config tree and generate files from dynamic templates generated by the user.
- template injections inside cli commands (cli options)
- Add star (\*) support so that all children could be copied

## Feature Idea #1 - Interactive Template and Config manager (Lipgloss?)

- Manage template configuration and see how it reflects in the template tree.
- Convert given folder into a template json, which is exported to scaffolder's valid json and later can be updated to be templated.
- Prompted scaffolding of the template (to inject custom variable values or keep default ones)

## Feature Idea #2 - CLI execution as -pre, -post steps of scaffolding

- Execution of `pre` and `post` cli commands as steps of scaffolding (could be useful for formatting, fixing linting errors, generating commits, etc.)
- Execution of `pre` and `post` cli commands as steps of scaffolding individual files/directories (could convert line endings, do something else, might not be as useful)

## Feature Idea #3 - Interactive and Non-interactive CLI

- Run scaffolder through command line (could be used in CI, automation, guides on what to paste to scaffold a project)
- Run scaffolder in interactive mode (useful for easier user experience, no need to prepare and copy paste same commands)

## Feature Idea #4 - Use HTTP to get config and template files

- Use scaffolder in HTTP mode which treats paths and configurations as remote sources.
  Could be useful if the template and configuration are hosted in a CDN or a static content server, which serves files through HTTP.
